# Notes and Checklist
## Notes
- [ ] ENTER
## General Checklist
- [ ] Implemented JUnit test
- [ ] All constants are `static final`
- [ ] No magic numbers
- [ ] Included class comments
- [ ] Included constructor comments
- [ ] Created "doc" directory
- [ ] Created Javadoc documentation html files
- [ ] `.equals()`, `.compareTo()`, and `.toString()` are all overridden in non-enum classes
- [ ] Accessibility of each method and variable is appropriate to the necessary function?
- [ ] Methods are at-most 40 lines
- [ ] Created *two* packages and their names are lowercase
- [ ] Not importing * from any packages
- [ ] You CANNOT use sysout `System.in` or `System.out` statements in ALL classes, EXCEPT the user interface class **ClinicManager.java** or the testbed `main()` methods. -2 points for each violation, with a maximum of -10 points.
	- REMOVE SYSOUT FROM LIST CLASS
- [ ] You must always add the `@Override` tag for overriding methods or -2 points for each violation.
- [ ] Polymorphism is required, i.e., dynamic binding for all the `equals()`, `compareTo()`, `toString()`, and the `rate()` method, and the methods in the generic `List<E>` class, or you will lose 10 points.
- [ ] You MUST implement or refactor the Java classes below. -5 points for each class missing or NOT used. You should define necessary constant names in UPPERCASE letters and DO NOT use MAGIC NUMBERs, or you will lose points listed in the Coding Standard.
- [ ] The UML Class diagram is generated and included in the project directory
	- [ ] For each rectangle (class), include ONLY the instance variables and public methods.
